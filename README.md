# HackMIT 2020 Oracles

## How To Run The Code
You may have noticed that there isn't a run.py. Sorry, this is work in progress. Instead, you can do the following:
* Windows: start index.html
* MacOS: open index.html
* Linux: xdg-open index.html

## Mission Statement

Mastery of concepts in higher education is difficult, particularly in vital yet academically competitive fields. This initiative for accomplishment is one that deserves to be appropriately addressed by providing an interface to connect “oracles” to these students, one which allows for productive and candid interactions.
